# UFO Sightings with JavaScript
Module 11 Challenge

## Overview of the UFO Sightings Analysis

### Background

> Danaâ€™d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

### Purpose

Use JavaScript and HTML to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Results

 Description of how to perform a search:
 
- A search can be performed using the filtering box, in which it can be filtered using one criteria or all for the "Filter Search": Date, City, State, Country, and Shape as shown in the folloing image.

1. To begin the search you required to enter a word that describes one of the five filters criteria. If shape filter is choosen, it's required to type the apropriate information in it and then click the enter button so the results can be displayed.

2. It can be filtered by one or more slection, it's not neccesary to fill out all the filters critearia, as shown below.

3. To clear the filter, it's just required to erase the data that have been filled in the filters.

## Summary

+ One drawback of this webpage, could be that a clearing filter button is missing. As shown above, in order to clearing the filters we required to erase each data from the filters instead of clicking a button that could be done quickly.

+ Two additional recommendations:

  + We can add some links to travel to other webpages
  + We can add some images thumbnails for the info.
